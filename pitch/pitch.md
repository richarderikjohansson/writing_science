I study trace gasses in Earths middle atmosphere. I work with questions that 
relate to the changing climate and how it affects the environment and life on Earth, 
such the recovery of the ozone layer. Additionally I research how water vapour concentrations
in the middle atmosphere relate to the current climate crisis
