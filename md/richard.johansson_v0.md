# Ozone depleting events during winter 2019-2020 from MIRA2 measurements
## Introduction
During the second half of the 20th century holes in the ozone layer began to 
form due to Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS). The absolute majority of the ODS gasses did not have a natural origin, 
but instead was formed from human activities. This prompted the Montreal Protocol, banning industries and other actors 
producing ODS gasses. 

Since the signing of the Montreal Protocol, the global reduction of ozone-depleting substances has driven significant 
recovery of the ozone layer, with levels moving closer to their pre-industrial state. At the same time, the deployment of
satellite instruments such as Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) aboard NASA’s Aura mission, along 
with ground-based  microwave radiometers, has greatly enhanced our ability to track ozone trends and confirm this recovery.
One of these ground-based microwave radiometers is MIRA2 measuring ozone at 273 GHz, situated within the Arctic circle, at the 
Swedish Institute of Space Physics in Kiruna, Sweden.

Although stratospheric ozone shows an overall increasing trend, episodes of chemical ozone depletion still occur in the 
polar regions under specific atmospheric conditions. A key precursor is the extremely low temperatures that develop 
within the polar vortices during the Arctic and Antarctic winters. One of the coldest and most stable Arctic polar 
vortices on record occurred during the winter of 2019–2020. In this study, we present a unique dataset of ozone 
measurements obtained with MIRA2 during the winter of 2019–2020. By integrating these observations with MLS/Aura data, 
we not only aim to rigorously validate MIRA2 but also to leverage this combined dataset to gain new insights into 
chemical ozone loss through tracer–tracer relationships, providing a more detailed understanding of polar stratospheric 
ozone dynamics.

## Data and analysis
A microwave radiometer measure the emitted radiation when a molecules transition from a higher energy state to a lower
one giving us a spectrum. The goal is to retrieve altitude dependent profiles of some quantity, in this case, the 
mixing ratio of ozone. This is achieved by processing the measurements through a retrieval algorithm

### MIRA2 data
MIRA2 have been operational at the Swedish Institute of Space Physics since 2012, with over 20000 measurements obtained
since then. In this study have measurements between October 1 2019 and April 30 2020 been processed with a newly developed
retrieval routine to investigate whether the measurements obtained show signs of ozone loss.

### MLS/Aura data
MLS/Aura is one of the most successful Earth Observing Systems(EOS) ever launched. It has continuously conducted 
measurements for more than two decades of some of the most important trace gasses, considering climate change, where 
ozone is one of them. Due to its orbit it manages to measure at approximately 3500 unique positions over a 24 hour period,
with nearly global coverage. 

Data used from MLS/Aura in this study is from the same timeperiod as the data obtained with MIRA2. However, the data 
used have already been processed by NASA, meaning that they have ran there raw measurements through their own retrieval
algorithms and is therefore ready to be used.
