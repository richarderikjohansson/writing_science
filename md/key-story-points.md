# Ozone depletion event winter 2019-2020 with MIRA2 measurements

## Opening
In the middle of the 20th century scientists started to observe ozone holes over Antarctica during spring. To combat 
this was the Montreal Protocol signed and as part of following up on the ozone trends is ozone measurements from 
around the globe of value 

## Question
Can MIRA2 show that chemical ozone depletion occured during winter 2019-2020 over the arctic? And how do MIRA2 ozone 
measurements compare with MLS/Aura

## Results 
1. Validation of MIRA2 measurements by comparisons with MLS/Aura
2. Identify ozone depletion

## Conclusion
MIRA2 showed good comparison with MLS/Aura from comprehensive study and statistical approach with comparisons. 
Furthmore, measurements from MIRA2 and tracer-tracer relations show significant chemical ozone depletion.
