# Chapter 1 
Writing should be thought of as a tool scientists use. Much like statistics is
a tool to interpret and measure data, is writing a tool to communicate
research. No matter how good the raw data, or how astounding the findings are,
will everything be wasted if it can not be communicated effectively. Scientific
writing is more about rewriting, rather than "writing". Almost every first
draft will not be good enough to publish. So the art of writing is more about
making a manusscript ever so slightly better for each draft. Being a successful
scientist will not be measured by the amount of published work, but rather on
usability of the paper. This mean that success really is measured by the number
of citations, here will it be essential that you as a writer have been able to
communicate the results.

# Chapter 2
Many scientists do not see their writing as writing a story, it almost feel
like deviating from what being a scientist is about. But in reality, the best
scientific writers are also great storytellers. Raw data itself does not tell a
story, however in that data there is a story waiting to come out. The art of
scientific writing is to find that story. It really is as simple as:

1. Collecting the data
2. Gain information from the data
3. Gain knowledge from the information
4. Understanding, and present the understanding 

The further along you can take the process from data to understanding, the
better will the paper be. The data will try to tell the story, let it be the
main character and listen to it. Their is essentially three aspects to
effective storytelling:

1. Content; what makes a story engage and stay with us?
2. Structure; how to put together that content to make it easy for us to get?
3. Language; How ro weite the story in the most compelling way possible

## Exercise 2.2: Write a short article
### Step 1. Identify the key story points for your work
1. What is your opening? This should identify the larger problem to which I am
   contributing, give readers a sense of the direction of the paper going, and
   make it clear why it is important. It should engage the widest audience
   practical.

2. What is the specific question or hypothesis?
3. That are the key results from the work? Identify these in a short list.
   There should be no more than two or three points
4. What is the main conclusion? What did you learn about nature? This should
   use the results from section 3 to answer
   the question from 2, and should address the larger problem identified in 1.

### Step 2. Write the article
Write a short article describing the research. Target audience is scientists
who are not specialists in my discipline. I will try to tell the story or the
work and engage and educate my readers, not write a technical paper. The tone
can range between somewhat technical and more sacual, but it must be something
that technical readers would find interesting. Use the answers from step 1 to
frame the story. Word limit is 800-850 words.

# Chapter 3
The secret to a good story is SUCCES, a abbreviation of **S**imple, **U**nexpected,
**C**oncrete, **C**redible, **E**motional and **S**tories.

## Simple
The *Simple* part of SUCCES is about finding a simple way of conveying a
message, rather than a simplistic way. There is a core difference here, where a
simple message is fining the core in a complex issue and where simplistic would
mean that the message is dumbned down.

Part of the simple language scheme is to express thoughts in language that
builds of ideas that the reader is familiar with. Know your target audience,
even if it is leading scientists in the field, try to find the simplest way on
conveying the message.
