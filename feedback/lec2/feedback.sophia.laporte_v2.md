# Feedback on Version 2
* The opening is good, where explainations on the characters are well put
  together in a simple, concise and credible manner
* The funnel between the opening and the challenge however might need some
  revision, where the paragraph highlighting the knowledge gap could be more
  concise
* The ending of the introduction could also be improved, as mentioned in the
  comments. The first sentence of the last paragraph could be used to end the
  introduction, and the tangent into seismology may be better suited in the
  Methods section
* Some clarifications into the locations of the seismic sensors could give a
  bit more context
* I think the presentation of the results were good, it was simple and concise
* The discussion was overall also good. However, some explainations and indepth
  explainations could improve this section, and connect better with the results
  presented 



## Exercise 4.2: OCAR
The opening is good as mentioned in the above list, however the challenge
become a bit lengthy, and could be more concise. The majority of the last
paragraph in the introduction might also be better in the Methods section,
giving it a smother transition from challenge to action

How the results were presented felt simple, credible and concise. However, some
expansion in the discussion would better explain some of the results presented.

## Exercise 5.2: Opening
Mentioned before, opening is good. Gives a good explaination into the subject
and is quite concrete.

## Exercise 6.2: Funnel
The transition from the opening and the challenges could maybe be improved by
keeping the knowledge gap more concise and remove redundant information
