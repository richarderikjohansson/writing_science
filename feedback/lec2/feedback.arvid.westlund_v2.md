# Feedback on Version 2
 
* Overall a improvement in some areas compared to v1, with a better opening and
  funnel to the challenge
* The latter parts of the introduction could use some revision, where I think
  the last paragraph starting with **"Objective:"** could be woven into the
  second paragraph or how it is presented in v1
* The third paragraph in the introduction might actually be better suited as the opening in the
  Methods section, giving a natural flow from the end of the introduction where
  4D-MRI is mentioned, to give a better context what 4D-MRIs are, and what they
  are used for in this study

* I liked how the data was presented, it is concise and credible with
  statistical parameters present.
* Some clarification into how, and why the locations for the measurements were
  chosen is missing
* The results are presented in a concise and credible manner. However, some
  revision might be needed for a simpler presentation. Especially in the first
  paragraph
* The conclusion is straight forward and feel concise and credible, and put
  into simple terms



## Exercise 4.2: OCAR
Feels like a typical OCAR structure, and quite well put together. The opening
connects well with the challenge, and already in the first paragraph the scope
of the study is clear. It is clear, concise and also spark some curiosity. 

The *Action* could however need some revision, as mentioned in the comments I
think one of the paragraphs regarding 4D-MRI is better suited in the Methods
section and that the last paragraph might be better in v1

The results is overall well presented, feels credible and concise. However,
might need some revision to make some things more clear as seen in the notes 

## Exercise 5.2: Opening
The opening paragraph is very strong, as mentioned. Liked the analogy with a
plumber, which helped with understanding

## Exercise 6.2: Funnel
The funnel from opening to the challenge feels natural, and I feel that the
first paragraph captures this quite well.
